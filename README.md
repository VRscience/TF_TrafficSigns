# TF_TrafficSigns is a Tensorflow based project to discriminate traffic signs. This project currently uses Belgian Traffic Signs as data. IT is a WIP based on DATACAMP TF tutorial. Dataset can be found within the tutorial page https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tensorflow-tutorial . I have also implemented a class named Loader to load the data to feed the NN.
