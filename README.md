# TF_TrafficSigns is a Tensorflow based project to discriminate traffic signs. This project currently uses Belgian Traffic Signs as data. It is a WIP based on the paper by M.Mathias et al. (2013) https://btsd.ethz.ch/shareddata/publications/Mathias-IJCNN-2013.pdf. Dataset can be found within the tutorial page https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tensorflow-tutorial . I have also implemented a class named Loader to load the data to feed the NN.
